This repo is created to learn about nlp related tasks with the help of transformers(specially using ðŸ¤— transformers).

We will start with [huggingface course](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter1/1) where we will learn about transformer, how it works, how to use huggingface already trained tranformer models for common nlp tasks like sentiment analysis, quetion answering, text classification, NER (named entity recognition), generating a new sentense from the input text etc.
